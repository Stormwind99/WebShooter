# Web Slinger

Spiders shoot webbing at you - slinging webs from a distance, or when they hit you in melee!

Be careful!  This makes spiders more difficult foes, since you get stuck in the webbing.

## FAQ

1. How to I make my mod's spiders also sling webs?

Subclass EntitySpider for your new spider - see EntityCaveSpider in vanilla MC for an example.

2. Can I sling webs myself?

In Creative mode or with console cheat commands, create webslinger:webbing items and throw them like snowballs.
